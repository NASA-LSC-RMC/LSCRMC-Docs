## Hours Tracking App

To get started:

1. Create a Retool user account [here](https://login.retool.com/auth/signup). Make sure you use your *athenian.org*
   email address.
2. Go to the [desktop](https://arc852.retool.com/apps/9ce8de80-23e6-11ec-9300-8b0f50e651e0/User%20Registration#)
   version of the app and register yourself under "User Registration." Registering is a one-time exercise.

Once registered, you can enter your hours with the desktop or mobile versions of the app:

* [Desktop](https://arc852.retool.com/apps/Hours%20Tracker)
* [Mobile](https://arc852.retool.com/apps/Mobile%20Hours%20Tracker)

We are tracking start/end times to assist with contact tracing efforts. So please enter accurate times.

The app does not validate a couple bad input combinations:

1) End time before Start time.
2) Overlapping time spans.
